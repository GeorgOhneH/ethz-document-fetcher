# ethz-document-fetcher
ethz-document-fetcher is a program which can fetch and organise all files from ethz websites like
 moodle, ilias, polybox and others.
 
 The main goal of this project is, that you can easily check if
 new exercises (or any other files) have been released/updated.
 
 Files from these sites will be updated:
 * Polybox

 * moodle
 
 Files from other sites will **not** be updated.
